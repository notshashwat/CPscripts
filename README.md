setup steps : 
1. make the addtions present in 'bashaddtions' to your .bashrc
2. edit the commands on 'bashadditions' to actual location of other files

How the new aliases work  :
 ncpp <filename> - makes a new cpp file <filename> using the template.cpp

 comp <filename> - compiles the cpp file <filename> 
 
 cpfolder <foldername> - makes a new cp folder with -
 	a.cpp b.cpp c.cpp d.cpp e.cpp input.txt output.txt
 
 tna - makes or rewrites input.txt to contain simple test cases for T,N,A type of cp problems , will be helpful in testing before submissions.
